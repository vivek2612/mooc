runclustering.sh : Runs clustering process for different values of K. 
	- To print out the stats associated with clustering ( varinces, coeff of variation etc.)
	- Files used:
		identifyClusters.py. (takes 1 argument = K)


1. identifyClusters.py. takes 1 argument = K
	- Can print out final centroids. 
	- Can print out stats associated with clustering. (coeff of variation, variance etc.)


2. plot-stateDiagram.py <filename with centroids>
	- Input : File with centroids ( as output by identifyClusters.py )
	- Output : Generate K images named <i>stategraph.png where i = [0,K-1]. K = number of clusters.
				Also generates html page 'state-diagram.html'. Showing these user profiles.

3. plotClustering.py 
	- Input : <filename with stats of betacv and betavar>
			  (As output by identifyClusters.py while printing stats)
	- Ouput : plots two graphs. These are called clusterplots.
